# codeQuizGame

## Description

My main goal with this project was to familiarize myself with javascript. I ended up gaining a better understanding of event listeners and how to pull/push to html. This project's purpose is to check our knowledge in a fun way. The easiest part of this project was setting up the main page (HTML and CSS). I struggled so much creating the quiz - I had a hard time planning out my functions/I had issues with my approach. I tried a few different approaches > ex. looping through the questions/answers and attaching a class that indicated which answer was correct but that didn't work out, haha. I relied heavily on Robbert's (my bootcamp teacher) mini project demos/class videos and the xpert tutoring tool!

Local storage was still a huge headache - I tried to figure out how to append instead of writing over the current value in local storage.

Referenced this video to see how they setup their quiz game/got an idea of how I wanted to set my js up:
